To the developer,

This project uses SCSS (a version of SASS) to compile all CSS files.
If you have never used SCSS, visit http://sass-lang.com/ to learn how to use it, and install the compiler.
All of the SCSS files are located in the "scss" folder on the root folder.

If you edit these compiled CSS files, please mark the SCSS files as outdated, or delete them to prevent versioning issues.
The compiled CSS files are minified for optimum download speed by the client. They are not intended to be human-readable.
